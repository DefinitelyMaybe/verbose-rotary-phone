The initial part of displaying a files history is the git command `git log`
Github's display of the histroy is a returned result of this command.
Github uses a url scheme like so:
`https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/commits/dev?after=3a9152af37e7879e5ed41cb60c549e6a78df57aa+104&branch=dev`
which pressumably feeds back into the git log command.

Another question for a later time is: how does the user interface support interactions with git?

To create a git history to search through, those commits must be created. What's the difference between saving and creating a git commit? when would the user?
